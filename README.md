## Optimising radiation therapy treatment schedules with deep reinforcement learning

* The model folder contains the code of the Python implementation of the simulation.

* The model_cpp folder contains the code of the C++ implementation of the simulation.

* The nnets folder contains the neural networks trained with different algorithms and reward functions as explained in the manuscript.

* The training_logs folder contains the training log files of the four agents described in the manuscript inside zip archives.

* The eval folder contains the performance evaluations of the different agents.

* The tmp folder contains the images created during the evaluation of the agents. 

* The misc folder contains files that couldn't be classified in the preceding folders.

* main.py is used to train an agent.

* use_network.py evaluates a neural network using the performance indicators described in the manuscript.
